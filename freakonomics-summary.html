  <h1>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything</h1>
  <div class="author">By Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner</div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Full Summary (Approx. 1100 words)</h2>
    <p>
      *Freakonomics* challenges conventional wisdom by using economic theory to explore unusual questions about human behavior. Economist Steven D. Levitt and journalist Stephen J. Dubner team up to apply data-driven reasoning to topics ranging from crime rates to cheating in sports and education.
    </p>

    <p>
      The book’s central idea is that incentives shape behavior. By analyzing hidden patterns and incentives, the authors reveal surprising truths that defy intuition. Their goal is not to explain economics in traditional terms, but to show how thinking like an economist — using data, incentives, and skepticism — can explain the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most controversial arguments in the book is that the drop in U.S. crime rates during the 1990s had less to do with policing or the economy and more to do with the legalization of abortion in the 1970s. The authors argue that unwanted children are statistically more likely to become criminals, and reducing their birth rates helped reduce crime decades later. This hypothesis sparked widespread debate for its moral and ethical implications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another chapter explores cheating in professional sports and standardized testing. Levitt shows how sumo wrestlers manipulate outcomes when incentives align — for example, when a wrestler needs one more win to maintain rank and his opponent has nothing to lose. Similarly, some teachers alter students’ test answers to boost their school’s performance metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      The authors analyze the economics of drug dealing through interviews with gang members. Surprisingly, most low-level drug dealers live in poverty. The gang operates like a corporation, with wealth concentrated at the top. This challenges the glamorous perception of drug dealing and shows how many risk danger for minimal rewards.
    </p>

    <p>
      A recurring theme is that correlation is not causation. Just because two things move together doesn’t mean one causes the other. The authors encourage readers to dig deeper into the data and question assumptions. Often, the real drivers of behavior are hidden below the surface.
    </p>

      In another section, Levitt and Dubner analyze baby names as cultural signals. They explore how socioeconomic status affects naming trends and how names rise and fall in popularity. The data shows that high-income families often adopt unique names first, which then trickle down over time to the mainstream.
    </p>

    <p>
      The book also investigates how parents influence children's success. Surprisingly, things like reading to your child daily matter less than larger socioeconomic indicators, such as the parents' education level and income. This highlights the complex web of factors that determine outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the book, Levitt and Dubner stress that economics is not about money — it's about understanding choice. From schoolteachers and drug dealers to sumo wrestlers and real estate agents, people respond to incentives in predictable ways. By uncovering these hidden motivations, we can better understand how the world works.
    </p>

    <p>
      *Freakonomics* is not a traditional economics textbook. It’s a fascinating, often provocative, journey into the unexpected. Its insights challenge how we think about morality, truth, and human nature — all through the lens of data.
    </p>

    <p>
      By combining clever questions with rigorous analysis, Levitt and Dubner open the door for anyone to think more critically and ask “What’s really going on here?” in everyday life. The book encourages curiosity, skepticism, and an appreciation for the stories hidden in numbers.
