  <h1>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</h1>
  <div class="author">By Yuval Noah Harari</div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Full Summary (Approx. 1300 words)</h2>
    <p>
      *Sapiens* is a sweeping narrative of the history of Homo sapiens, from the emergence of archaic human species to the present day. Harari divides the history of our species into four major revolutions: the Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution, Unification of Humankind, and the Scientific Revolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Cognitive Revolution, which occurred around 70,000 years ago, allowed Homo sapiens to develop language, imagination, and shared myths. This revolution enabled larger groups to cooperate flexibly, giving Sapiens a unique advantage over other species. Harari argues that fiction — religion, nationhood, money — is what unites large groups under common goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Agricultural Revolution, around 12,000 years ago, marked the shift from foraging to farming. While it allowed population growth, Harari calls it a “fraud” in terms of happiness. People worked harder, had poorer diets, and lived in more confined social structures. The agricultural shift benefitted the species, but often at the cost of individual well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next phase was the gradual Unification of Humankind. Cultures spread, empires rose and fell, and trade networks expanded. Harari explains that money, empires, and organized religions played crucial roles in bringing diverse populations together under common ideologies. These systems helped create global cooperation, often at the cost of violence, inequality, and colonization.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Scientific Revolution began around 500 years ago and is still ongoing. It introduced a shift in mindset: from seeking knowledge through tradition to exploring through observation and experimentation. This revolution fueled enormous technological, political, and economic changes — including capitalism, industry, and global empires. Harari emphasizes that the real power came not from new inventions alone, but from the willingness to admit ignorance and seek improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most thought-provoking ideas in *Sapiens* is that history has no clear direction or goal. Human progress doesn’t always lead to more happiness or morality. Harari challenges readers to question the costs of so-called “advancement,” including ecological destruction, animal suffering, and psychological distress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Harari also discusses the rise of capitalism and consumerism. He suggests that happiness has become linked to constant growth and desire, which creates a cycle of consumption and dissatisfaction. Religious and national narratives have been replaced with faith in the market, science, and human rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the final chapters, Harari reflects on biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and genetic engineering. He questions whether Homo sapiens will remain the dominant species or give way to post-human entities created by our own innovations. The book ends by posing deep ethical and philosophical questions about what kind of future we are building — and whether it’s a future we truly desire.
    </p>

    <p>
      *Sapiens* is more than a history book — it’s a reflection on the human condition. Harari combines anthropology, biology, economics, and philosophy to paint a broad yet accessible picture of how we became who we are. He invites readers to reconsider accepted truths and explore how we might shape the future with wisdom and responsibility.
